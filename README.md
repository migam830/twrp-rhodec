# TWRP recovery for Moto G62 5G
This is my attempt to build TWRP for the Moto G62 5G phone. I have managed to get the recovery image to build but the touchscreen isn't working. I created this repo just in case I somehow figure out a fix.

If you have any idea how to get the touchscreen to work, open an issue or submit a pull request. Any help is much appreciated.
